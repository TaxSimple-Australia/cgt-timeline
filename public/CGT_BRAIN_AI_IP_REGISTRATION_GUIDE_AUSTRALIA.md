## 2. Copyright Protection in Australia

### 2.1 Overview

**IMPORTANT: Copyright protection in Australia is FREE and AUTOMATIC.**

Unlike patents and trademarks, there is **no registration system** for copyright in Australia. Copyright protection arises automatically the moment an original work is created and expressed in a tangible form.

### 2.2 What Copyright Protects for Software

Copyright protects the following aspects of CGT Brain AI:

- **Source code** - All programming code (TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, etc.)
- **Software documentation** - User manuals, technical specifications
- **User interface designs** - Original visual layouts and artistic elements
- **Database structures** - Original compilations of data
- **Literary works** - Any written content within the application
- **Sound recordings** - If the AI uses voice features

### 2.3 Duration of Copyright Protection

| Type of Work | Duration |
|-------------|----------|
| Computer programs (software) | 70 years from the end of the year the author dies |
| Literary works | 70 years from the end of the year the author dies |
| Sound recordings | 70 years from the end of the year first published |
| Films/Cinematographic works | 70 years from the end of the year first published |

### 2.4 How to Establish Copyright Ownership

While registration is not required, the following practices help prove ownership:

1. **Date stamp your work** - Maintain version control records (Git commits serve this purpose)
2. **Keep development records** - Preserve drafts, iterations, and development logs
3. **Include copyright notices** - Add notices to your code and materials:
   ```
   © 2024-2026 Tax Simple Australia Pty Ltd. All rights reserved.
   ```
4. **Use NDA agreements** - When sharing confidential information
5. **Employment contracts** - Ensure clear IP assignment clauses for developers
6. **Backup securely** - Maintain dated backups of all source code

### 2.5 Copyright Infringement and Enforcement

Copyright owners have exclusive rights to:
- Reproduce the work
- Publish the work
- Communicate the work to the public
- Make adaptations
- License these rights to others

**Enforcement options include:**
- Cease and desist letters
- Mediation and negotiation
- Court action for damages and injunctions
- Border protection (for physical goods)

### 2.6 Relevant Legislation

- **Copyright Act 1968 (Cth)** - Primary legislation
- **Copyright Regulations 2017** - Supplementary regulations
- **Copyright (International Protection) Regulations 1969**

## 3. Patent Registration in Australia

### 3.1 Overview

Patents protect **inventions** - new ways of doing things, technical solutions to problems, and innovations in how things work. For CGT Brain AI, patents could protect novel algorithms, technical processes, or innovative computational methods.

**Administered by:** IP Australia
**Website:** [https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/patents](https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/patents)

### 3.2 Types of Patents in Australia

| Patent Type | Protection Period | Status |
|------------|------------------|--------|
| **Standard Patent** | Up to 20 years (25 years for pharmaceuticals) | Available |
| **Provisional Patent** | 12 months (priority date holder) | Available |
| **Innovation Patent** | Was 8 years | **No longer available for new applications** |

### 3.3 Software Patent Eligibility in Australia

**Key 2025 Development - Aristocrat Decision:**

Following the landmark case *Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents* [2025] FCAFC 131, the patentability of computer-implemented inventions (CIIs) in Australia has become more favourable.

**The test for patentability:**
- The invention must involve more than just manipulation of an abstract idea in a computer
- It must implement an abstract idea in a computer to produce an "artificial state of affairs and a useful result"
- The invention must have "technical character" in substance

**What CAN be patented:**
- Novel algorithms with technical application
- AI systems that solve technical problems
- Data processing methods that produce tangible results
- Software that improves computer functionality

**What CANNOT be patented:**
- Abstract ideas or mathematical formulas alone
- Business methods without technical implementation
- Mere presentations of information
- Schemes or plans without technical substance

### 3.4 Patent Application Process

#### Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Research Your Invention**
- Keep your invention confidential before filing
- Decide between provisional, standard, or international (PCT) patent
- Research costs and renewal fees

**Step 2: Search Existing Patents**
- Use AusPat database: [https://inspire.wipo.int/auspat](https://inspire.wipo.int/auspat)
- Search international databases
- Check for prior art

**Step 3: Prepare Required Documents**
- Ownership and inventor details
- Australian/New Zealand agent address
- Detailed specification (description and claims)
- Payment information
- Sequence listings (if applicable)

**Step 4: File Your Application**
- Create account with IP Australia Online Services
- Complete application form (approximately 15 minutes)
- Upload specification document
- Pay application fee

**Step 5: Publication**
- Patent published in Australian Official Journal of Patents
- Available in Australian Patent Search database

**Step 6: Request Examination**
- Can be requested at filing or within 5 years
- Pay examination fee
- Processing typically takes up to 12 months

**Step 7: Address Examination Issues**
- 12 months to resolve any issues raised
- Failure to resolve causes application to lapse

**Step 8: Acceptance and Grant**
- If approved, published for 3-month opposition period
- Third parties can oppose grant
- Once granted, protection begins

### 3.5 Provisional Patent Applications

A provisional patent is an **optional, inexpensive first step** that:
- Establishes your priority date
- Gives you 12 months to decide on full patent
- Signals to competitors you're seeking protection
- Keeps technical details confidential
- Enables international-type search option

**Important:** A provisional patent does NOT provide enforceable protection. You must convert to a standard patent within 12 months.

### 3.6 International Patent Protection (PCT)

The **Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)** allows filing a single international application for protection in 150+ countries.

**Key features:**
- Single application for multiple countries
- One set of formalities
- No immediate translation required
- 31 months from priority date to enter national phases

**Filing options:**
- ePCT (WIPO's online system): [https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/](https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/)
- Through IP Australia as Receiving Office

**IP Australia's role:**
- Acts as Receiving Office (RO)
- International Searching Authority (ISA)
- International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA)

## 5. Business Name / Trade Name Registration

### 5.1 Overview

A **business name** is the name you trade under, which may be different from your legal company name. In Australia, business names are registered with ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission).

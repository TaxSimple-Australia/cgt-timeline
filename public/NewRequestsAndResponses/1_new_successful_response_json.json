However, for CGT purposes you can continue treating a property as your main residence: for up to 6 years if you used it to produce income, such as rent (sometimes called the '6-year rule') indefinitely if you didn't use it to produce income. During the time that you treat the property as your main residence after you stop living in it: It continues to be exempt from CGT (the same as if you were still living in it, even if you start renting it out after you leave). You can't treat any other property as your main residence (except for up to 6 months if you are moving house). Eligibility If the property was continuously your main residence, the usual rules for the main residence exemption apply.

The rules are complex and appropriate tax advice should be obtained. Subdividing adjacent land If a dwelling purchased after 20 September 1985 is a person’s main residence and they subdivide the land, this may affect the main residence exemption applicable to any blocks of land the dwelling is not situated on. The parcel of vacant land is not exempt from CGT under the main residence exemption if the client disposes of the land separately from the dwelling15. This means that a capital gain may be assessed for that block of land from the date the client first acquired the property. If the subdivided blocks were sold together with the block containing the dwelling, despite the subdivision, the block without the dwelling will also qualify for a full main residence CGT exemption.

Property 2, however, incurs a CGT liability due to its partial main residence exemption, as it was not the main residence for the entire ownership period. The key reason for the exemption of Properties 1 and 3 is that they were the main residences throughout their ownership, while Property 2 was rented out during part of its ownership, leading to a partial exemption. The cross-property issue of main residence overlap was resolved by not applying the six-year rule to Property 2, as Property 1 was claimed as the main residence during the overlap period.",

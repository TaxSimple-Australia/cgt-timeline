The owner then moved out and started renting it on the same day (20 August 2015). Crucially, the owner moved into another property (456 Johnson Avenue) the very next day (21 August 2015), making that property the new main residence. Because another property became the main residence during the rental period, the six-year rule does not apply to this property.",

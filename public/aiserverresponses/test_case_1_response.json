  "analysis": "# CGT ANALYSIS - PROPERTY PORTFOLIO\n\n## PROPERTY 1: 123 Main Street, Sydney, NSW 2000\n\n### 1. Scenario and Applicable Rules\n\n**Scenario:** Main Residence Exemption\n\n**Timeline:**\n- 15 January 2015: Purchased\n- 15 January 2015: Moved in (same day)\n- 30 June 2023: Sold\n- **Total ownership period:** 8 years, 5 months, 15 days (3,088 days)\n- **Period as main residence:** 3,088 days (100% of ownership)\n\n**Applicable Rules:**\n\nThis property qualifies for analysis under **RULE 4** (main_residence_complete_guide.pdf, page 3), which states:\n\n> \"Your main residence (your home) is exempt from CGT if you're an Australian resident and the dwelling:\n> - has been the home of you, your partner and other dependants for the whole period you have owned it\n> - hasn't been used to produce income\n> - is on land of 2 hectares or less.\"\n\n### 2. Capital Gain Calculation\n\n**Not applicable** - Full exemption applies (see below)\n\nSince no purchase price or sale price was provided in the portfolio data, I cannot calculate the actual capital gain amount. However, the calculation methodology would be:\n\n```\nCapital Gain = Sale Proceeds - Cost Base - Selling Costs\n```\n\n### 3. Exemptions\n\n**FULL MAIN RESIDENCE EXEMPTION APPLIES**\n\nBased on the facts provided:\n\n\u2705 **Moved in immediately upon purchase** (15 January 2015)\n\u2705 **Lived in property for entire ownership period** (100% of 3,088 days)\n\u2705 **No income-producing use mentioned** (no rental, business, or flipping activity)\n\u2705 **No indication of land exceeding 2 hectares**\n\n**Conclusion per RULE 4:**\n> \"If you meet these conditions, you don't pay tax on any capital gain when you sell your home and you ignore any capital loss.\"\n\n**CGT Liability for Property 1: $0**\n\n### 4. Cross-Property Considerations\n\n**Impact from other properties:** NONE\n\nThis is a single-property portfolio. There are no other properties that could:\n- Compete for main residence status\n- Trigger six-year rule complications\n- Create partial exemption issues\n\n**Impact on other properties:** N/A (no other properties exist)\n\n---\n\n## TOTAL PORTFOLIO CGT LIABILITY\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Property | Address | Capital Gain | Exemption | Taxable Gain | CGT Payable |\n|----------|---------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|\n| 1 | 123 Main Street, Sydney | Not calculated* | 100% | $0 | **$0** |\n\n*Insufficient data provided (no purchase/sale prices)\n\n### **TOTAL CGT LIABILITY: $0**\n\n---\n\n## RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n### \u2705 Compliance Actions Required\n\n1. **Record Keeping (RULE 1 requirement)**\n   - Maintain proof of purchase date (15 Jan 2015)\n   - Keep evidence of move-in date (15 Jan 2015)\n   - Retain utility bills, electoral roll records, mail delivery evidence\n   - Keep sale contract (30 June 2023)\n   - Document that land is \u22642 hectares (site plans)\n\n2. **Tax Return Reporting**\n   - Even though CGT is $0, you should report the sale in your 2022-23 tax return\n   - Complete the CGT schedule showing the exemption claimed\n   - This creates an audit trail and demonstrates compliance\n\n3. **Documentation to Retain**\n   Per RULE 1:\n   > \"evidence of how your property qualifies as a main residence\"\n   \n   Keep for 5 years after the sale:\n   - Settlement statements\n   - Rates notices showing your name\n   - Driver's license records\n   - Bank statements with property address\n   - Electoral roll evidence\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Optimization Opportunities\n\n**NONE REQUIRED** - This is the optimal outcome. You have achieved:\n- 100% main residence exemption\n- Zero CGT liability\n- No partial exemption calculations needed\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f Potential Issues Identified\n\n**NONE** - This is a straightforward, clean main residence exemption case with no complications.\n\n---\n\n## CONFLICTS OR ISSUES\n\n### No Conflicts Detected\n\nThis portfolio presents **no CGT conflicts or complications** because:\n\n1. \u2705 Single property only (no competing main residence claims)\n2. \u2705 Occupied immediately and continuously\n3. \u2705 No income-producing use\n4. \u2705 No absence periods requiring six-year rule analysis\n5. \u2705 No land size issues (assumed \u22642 hectares)\n6. \u2705 No partial exemption calculations required\n\n---\n\n## FINAL ANSWER\n\n**Your CGT on this property sale is: $0 (NIL)**\n\nYou qualify for the **full main residence exemption** under section 118-110 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The property was your home for the entire period of ownership, was not used to produce income, and meets all eligibility criteria per RULE 4.\n\n**Action Required:** Report the sale in your 2022-23 tax return with the main residence exemption claimed, and retain all supporting documentation for 5 years.",

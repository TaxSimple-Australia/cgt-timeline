The property was your main residence before renting\n2. You don't treat another property as your main residence during this period\n\n**CRITICAL CROSS-PROPERTY CONFLICT:**\n\n| Period | Property 1 Status | Other Main Residence | Six-Year Rule Valid? |\n|--------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 1 Jul 2010 - 30 Aug 2012 | Rental (2.16 yrs) | **Property 2 (tenant)** | \u274c NO - You were renting |\n| 1 Sep 2012 - 1 Jul 2016 | Rental (3.84 yrs) | **Property 4 (owned & occupied)** | \u274c NO - Treating P4 as main residence |\n| 2 Jul 2016 - 20 Nov 2018 | Rental (2.39 yrs) | **Property 4 (owned & occupied)** | \u274c NO - Treating P4 as main residence |\n\n**Conclusion:** The six-year rule is **INVALIDATED** because:\n1. You treated Property 2 as your main residence (2010-2012) [RULE 5 - only one main residence at a time]\n2. You treated Property 4 as your main residence (2012-2020)\n\n#### CGT Calculation for Property 1:\n\n**Exempt portion:** 5.43 years \u00f7 13.86 years = **39.18% exempt**\n\n**Taxable portion:** 8.39 years \u00f7 13.86 years = **60.52% taxable**\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nCapital Gain = Sale Price - Purchase Price - Costs\nTaxable Gain = Capital Gain \u00d7 60.52%\nCGT Discount (if held >12 months) = 50% reduction\nNet Taxable Gain = Taxable Gain \u00d7 50%\nCGT Liability = Net Taxable Gain \u00d7 Marginal Tax Rate\n```\n\n**Missing Data Required:**\n- Purchase price (2005)\n- Sale price (2018)\n- Purchase costs (stamp duty, legal fees)\n- Sale costs (agent fees, legal fees)\n- Capital improvements during ownership\n- Marginal tax rate for 2018-19 financial year\n\n---\n\n### PROPERTY 2: Apartment (RENTED AS TENANT) \u2705 **NO CGT**\n\n**Status:** You were a **tenant**, not owner\n- No CGT implications\n- This was your main residence 20 Jun 2010 - 30 Aug 2012\n- **Impact on Property 1:** Prevents six-year rule application during this period\n\n---\n\n### PROPERTY 3: Investment Property \u2705 **NOT SOLD - NO CGT EVENT**\n\n**Timeline:**\n- 15 Mar 2011: Purchase\n- 1 Apr 2011: Rent start\n- Never occupied as main residence\n\n**Status:** Pure investment property\n- **No main residence exemption available** [RULE 5 - never lived in]\n- When sold: Full CGT applies (with 50% discount if held >12 months)\n- Currently held: 13+ years (discount eligible)\n\n**Future CGT Calculation (when sold):**\n```\nCapital Gain = Sale Price - Purchase Price - Costs\nLess: 50% CGT discount\nTaxable Gain = Capital Gain \u00d7 50%\n```\n\n---\n\n### PROPERTY 4: Second Home \u2705 **NOT SOLD - NO CGT EVENT**\n\n**Timeline:**\n- 1 Sep 2012: Purchase & Move in\n- 10 Mar 2020: Move out\n- **7.53 years as main residence**\n- Never rented or used for income\n\n**Status:** Fully exempt main residence\n- 100% main residence exemption available [RULE 4]\n- No income production\n- Occupied entire ownership period until move-out\n\n**When sold:** Likely 100% exempt (unless rented after move-out)\n\n**Impact on Property 1:** Your occupation of Property 4 prevented six-year rule application to Property 1 during 2012-2018\n\n---\n\n### PROPERTY 5: Current Home \u2705 **NOT SOLD - NO CGT EVENT**\n\n**Timeline:**\n- 15 Mar 2020: Purchase & Move in\n- Current main residence\n\n**Status:** Current main residence\n- Will be fully exempt if sold while occupied [RULE 4]\n- No CGT issues currently\n\n---\n\n## CROSS-PROPERTY IMPACT ANALYSIS\n\n### Main Residence Timeline (Critical for Property 1 CGT)\n\n```\n2005-2010: Property 1 (owned & occupied) \u2705\n2010-2012: Property 2 (rented as tenant) \u26a0\ufe0f Blocks P1 six-year rule\n2012-2020: Property 4 (owned & occupied) \u26a0\ufe0f Blocks P1 six-year rule\n2020-now:  Property 5 (owned & occupied)\n```\n\n**Key Finding:** You maintained continuous main residence coverage, but this **prevents** the six-year absence rule from applying to Property 1's rental period.\n\n---\n\n## TOTAL CGT LIABILITY CALCULATION\n\n### Properties with CGT Events:\n**Only Property 1** has been sold.\n\n### CGT Liability Formula:\n\n```\nProperty 1 CGT = [(Sale Price - Purchase Price - Costs) \u00d7 60.52% \u00d7 50%] \u00d7 MTR\n\nWhere:\n- 60.52% = taxable portion (rental period)\n- 50% = CGT discount (held >12 months)\n- MTR = Marginal Tax Rate (2018-19)\n```\n\n### Example Calculation (Illustrative):\nAssuming:\n- Purchase price: $400,000\n- Sale price: $800,000\n- Costs: $50,000\n- Marginal tax rate: 37%\n\n```\nCapital Gain = $800,000 - $400,000 - $50,000 = $350,000\nTaxable portion = $350,000 \u00d7 60.52% = $211,820\nAfter CGT discount = $211,820 \u00d7 50% = $105,910\nCGT Liability = $105,910 \u00d7 37% = $39,187\n```\n\n**ACTUAL LIABILITY: Cannot be determined without financial data**\n\n---\n\n## RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n### 1. **Immediate Actions for Property 1 (Already Sold)**\n\n\u2705 **Obtain all financial records:**\n- Property 1 purchase contract (2005)\n- Property 1 sale contract (2018)\n- All improvement receipts (renovations, extensions)\n- Rental income records (2010-2018)\n- Depreciation schedules\n\n\u2705 **Prepare CGT calculation:**\n- Use partial exemption formula (39.18% exempt)\n- Apply 50% CGT discount\n- Report in 2018-19 tax return (if not already done)\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **If not yet reported:** This is now 5+ years overdue. Consider:\n- Voluntary disclosure to ATO\n- Engage tax professional immediately\n- Potential penalties and interest apply\n\n### 2. **Future Planning for Property 3 (Investment)**\n\nThis property has **zero main residence exemption** available.\n\n**Options to minimize CGT:**\n- Hold until retirement (lower tax bracket)\n- Consider timing of sale with lower income years\n- Offset against capital losses from other investments\n- 50% discount applies (held >12 months)\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Move into Property 3 temporarily before sale (won't help - already established as pure investment)\n\n### 3. **Property 4 Strategy**\n\nCurrently vacant (moved out Mar 2020).\n\n**Options:**\n\n**Option A: Sell soon (before renting)**\n- 100% main residence exemption\n- No CGT liability\n- **Best CGT outcome**\n\n**Option B: Rent out**\n- Can use six-year rule IF you don't buy another main residence\n- But you already own Property 5 as main residence\n- Six-year rule **NOT available**\n- Partial exemption only\n\n**Recommendation:** If considering selling Property 4, do so **before** renting it out to preserve full exemption.\n\n### 4. **Property 5 (Current Home)**\n\nNo issues. Maintain as main residence.\n\n### 5. **Record Keeping** [RULE 2]\n\nEnsure you maintain for all properties:\n- Purchase/sale contracts\n- Improvement receipts\n- Occupancy records\n- Rental agreements and income records\n- Utility bills showing occupancy\n- Electoral roll evidence\n\n---\n\n## CONFLICTS & ISSUES IDENTIFIED\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **Issue 1: Property 1 Six-Year Rule Failure**\n\n**Problem:** The scenario label suggests \"rental_property_exemption\" but the six-year rule does NOT apply because you maintained another main residence throughout the rental period.\n\n**Impact:** 60.52% of Property 1's gain is taxable (not fully exempt as scenario name suggests)\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **Issue 2: Potential Unreported CGT**\n\nProperty 1 sold in November 2018 (FY 2018-19). If CGT not reported:\n- Tax return amendment required\n- Penalties: Up to 75% of tax shortfall\n- Interest: General Interest Charge from due date\n- **Action required immediately**\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **Issue 3: Property 4 Timing Risk**\n\nProperty 4 vacant since March 2020 (4+ years ago).\n\n**Risk:** If you rent it out now:\n- Lose full main residence exemption\n- Six-year rule won't apply (Property 5 is main residence)\n- Partial exemption only\n\n**Recommendation:** Sell before renting if disposal planned.\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY TABLE\n\n| Property | Status | CGT Event? | Exemption | CGT Liability |\n|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------------|\n| Property 1 | Sold 2018 | \u2705 YES | 39.18% exempt | **TAXABLE** - Data needed |\n| Property 2 | Tenant | \u274c NO | N/A | $0 (not owned) |\n| Property 3 | Held | \u274c NO | 0% exempt | Future liability |\n| Property 4 | Held | \u274c NO | 100% exempt (if sold now) | $0 (if sold before renting) |\n| Property 5 | Held | \u274c NO | 100% exempt | $0 |\n\n**TOTAL CURRENT CGT LIABILITY: Property 1 only - amount cannot be calculated without financial data**\n\n---\n\n## REQUIRED INFORMATION TO CALCULATE EXACT LIABILITY\n\nPlease provide for Property 1:\n1. Purchase price (2005)\n2. Sale price (2018)\n3. Purchase costs (stamp duty, legal, etc.)\n4. Sale costs (agent commission, legal, etc.)\n5. Capital improvements (with dates and amounts)\n6. Your marginal tax rate in 2018-19\n7. Confirmation whether this was reported in 2018-19 tax return\n\n---\n\n**URGENT:** If Property 1 CGT has not been reported, seek professional tax advice immediately to minimize penalties.",

01/01/2020): 17 years**\n- Fully exempt as main residence [RULE 4: dwelling was home, no income-producing use]\n\n**Period 2 (01/01/2020 - 14/07/2023): 3.54 years**\n- Attempting to use 6-year absence rule\n- **PROBLEM**: The 6-year rule requires that you don't treat another property as your main residence during the absence period [RULE 5]\n- Property 3 (Boyne Island) was purchased and occupied as main residence from 30/09/2021\n- **VIOLATION**: From 30/09/2021 onwards, Property 3 was the main residence, which **disqualifies** the 6-year rule for Property 1\n\n**Exemption Calculation**:\n- Total ownership: 20.54 years (7,500 days)\n- Exempt period: 17 years + 1.71 years (until Property 3 became main residence) = 18.71 years (6,832 days)\n- Taxable period: 1.83 years (668 days)\n\n**Partial Exemption**: 6,832 / 7,500 = **91.1% exempt**\n\n**CGT Calculation** (assuming figures):\n- Without actual purchase/sale prices, cannot calculate specific gain\n- **Formula**: Capital Gain \u00d7 8.9% \u00d7 50% (CGT discount) = **4.45% of total gain is taxable**\n\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f **PARTIAL CGT LIABILITY** - 6-year rule fails due to Property 3\n\n---\n\n### PROPERTY 2: 50 Flynn Circuit, Bellamack, NT 0832\n**Scenario**: Rental Property (attempting exemption)\n\n**Timeline**:\n- 05/06/2014: Purchase\n- 20/06/2014: Rent started (15 days later)\n- Still owned (not sold)\n\n**Analysis**:\n- **Never occupied as main residence** - rented immediately after purchase\n- Cannot claim main residence exemption [RULE 4: must be \"the home of you\"]\n- Cannot use 6-year absence rule (requires property to first be established as main residence)\n- **NO EXEMPTION AVAILABLE**\n\n**CGT Status**: \n- **NO CGT EVENT YET** (property not sold)\n- When sold: **100% taxable** (may qualify for 50% CGT discount if held >12 months)\n\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f **FULL CGT LIABILITY WHEN SOLD** - Never a main residence\n\n---\n\n### PROPERTY 3: 5 Wanda Dr, Boyne Island, Qld 4680\n**Scenario**: Main Residence Exemption\n\n**Timeline**:\n- 30/09/2021: Purchase & Move in\n- 15/04/2022: Improvement (cost base addition)\n- Still owned (not sold)\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Occupied as main residence from purchase\n- **CONFLICT**: Property 4 claims to be main residence from 01/01/2020\n- **RESOLUTION REQUIRED**: You cannot have two main residences simultaneously\n\n**If Property 3 is designated as main residence from 30/09/2021**:\n- Fully exempt for period owned [RULE 4]\n- Improvements add to cost base (no CGT implication if fully exempt)\n- Land must be \u22642 hectares [RULE 2]\n\n**CGT Status**:\n- **NO CGT EVENT YET** (property not sold)\n- **Potentially 100% exempt** if properly designated as main residence\n\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f **CONFLICTS WITH PROPERTY 4** - Designation required\n\n---\n\n### PROPERTY 4: Rental Property, Boyne Island, Qld 4680\n**Scenario**: Claims Main Residence Exemption\n\n**Timeline**:\n- 01/01/2020: Move in\n- No purchase date provided (concerning)\n- Still owned (not sold)\n\n**Critical Issues**:\n1. **No purchase date recorded** - cannot determine ownership period\n2. **Conflicts with Property 1**: From 01/01/2020, if this is main residence, Property 1 cannot use 6-year rule\n3. **Conflicts with Property 3**: From 30/09/2021, both claim main residence status\n\n**Analysis**:\n- **IMPOSSIBLE SCENARIO**: Cannot be main residence while Property 3 is also main residence\n- Must choose ONE property as main residence for each time period\n\n**CGT Status**:\n- **NO CGT EVENT YET** (property not sold)\n- Exemption depends on main residence designation choices\n\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f **MAJOR CONFLICT** - Overlapping main residence claims\n\n---\n\n## CROSS-PROPERTY IMPACT MATRIX\n\n| Time Period | Property 1 | Property 2 | Property 3 | Property 4 | Issue |\n|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|\n| 2003-2014 | Main Res \u2713 | Not owned | Not owned | Unknown | \u2713 Valid |\n| 2014-2020 | Main Res \u2713 | Rental | Not owned | Unknown | \u2713 Valid |\n| 2020-Sep 2021 | Rental | Rental | Not owned | Claims Main Res | \u26a0\ufe0f If P4 is main res, P1 loses 6-year rule |\n| Sep 2021-Jul 2023 | Rental | Rental | Main Res? | Claims Main Res? | \u274c CONFLICT: Two main residences |\n| Jul 2023-Present | Sold | Rental | Main Res? | Claims Main Res? | \u274c CONFLICT: Two main residences |\n\n---\n\n## TOTAL CGT LIABILITY CALCULATION\n\n### Properties with CGT Events (Sold):\n\n**Property 1 Only** (sold 14/07/2023):\n- **Partial exemption**: 91.1% exempt, 8.9% taxable\n- **Requires**: Purchase price, sale price, costs\n- **Estimated liability**: 4.45% of capital gain (after 50% discount)\n\n### Properties Not Yet Sold:\n- **Property 2**: 100% taxable when sold\n- **Property 3**: Potentially 100% exempt (if designated main residence)\n- **Property 4**: Status unclear due to conflicts\n\n### **CURRENT TOTAL CGT LIABILITY**: \n**Cannot calculate without purchase/sale prices for Property 1**\n\n**Formula for Property 1**:\n```\nCapital Gain = Sale Price - (Purchase Price + Costs)\nTaxable Gain = Capital Gain \u00d7 8.9%\nDiscounted Gain = Taxable Gain \u00d7 50%\nCGT Liability = Discounted Gain \u00d7 Marginal Tax Rate\n```\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n### 1. **IMMEDIATE: Resolve Main Residence Conflicts**\n\n**For 01/01/2020 - 30/09/2021 period**:\n- **Option A**: Designate Property 4 as main residence\n  - Result: Property 1 loses 6-year rule from 01/01/2020\n  - Property 1 exemption: 17/20.54 years = 82.8% exempt\n  \n- **Option B**: Continue Property 1 as main residence (absence rule)\n  - Result: Property 4 cannot be main residence\n  - Property 1 exemption: 18.71/20.54 years = 91.1% exempt (BETTER)\n\n**For 30/09/2021 onwards**:\n- **MUST CHOOSE**: Property 3 OR Property 4 as main residence\n- **Recommendation**: Choose Property 3 (actual residence with move-in date)\n- Property 4 becomes fully taxable investment property\n\n### 2. **Property 1 - Optimization**\n\n**Best Strategy**:\n- Do NOT designate Property 4 as main residence for 2020-2021 period\n- Claim Property 1 under 6-year rule until 30/09/2021\n- Accept partial exemption from 30/09/2021 to sale (when Property 3 became main residence)\n- **Result**: 91.1% exempt, minimal CGT\n\n### 3. **Property 2 - Future Planning**\n\n- **No exemption available** - always been rental\n- Consider timing of sale relative to other capital gains\n- Ensure all rental expenses and depreciation properly claimed\n- 50% CGT discount applies (held >12 months)\n\n### 4. **Property 3 - Designation**\n\n- **Formally designate** as main residence from 30/09/2021\n- Ensure land is \u22642 hectares [RULE 2]\n- Keep records of occupancy [RULE 1]\n- Should be 100% exempt when sold\n\n### 5. **Property 4 - Clarification Needed**\n\n**Missing Information**:\n- Purchase date\n- Actual occupancy evidence\n- Whether actually lived in or investment property\n\n**Recommendation**:\n- If actually occupied: Designate as main residence ONLY for period before Property 3 (but this hurts Property 1)\n- If investment property: Treat as rental from purchase\n- **Best outcome**: Do NOT designate as main residence at all\n\n### 6. **Documentation Required**\n\nFor each property, gather:\n- \u2713 Purchase contracts and settlement statements\n- \u2713 Sale contracts (Property 1)\n- \u2713 Utility bills showing occupancy\n- \u2713 Electoral roll records\n- \u2713 Rental agreements and income records\n- \u2713 Improvement receipts (Property 3)\n- \u2713 Land size certificates [RULE 2]\n\n---\n\n## MAIN RESIDENCE ELECTION STRATEGY\n\n### **Recommended Timeline**:\n\n| Period | Main Residence | Rationale |\n|--------|---------------|-----------|\n| 2003-2020 | Property 1 | Actual residence |\n| 2020-Sep 2021 | Property 1 (6-year rule) | Maximizes Property 1 exemption |\n| Sep 2021-Present | Property 3 | Actual residence, full exemption |\n\n**Property 4**: Do NOT elect as main residence for any period\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY OF CGT POSITIONS\n\n| Property | Status | CGT Liability | Action Required |\n|----------|--------|---------------|-----------------|\n| **Property 1** | SOLD | **4.45% of gain taxable** | Calculate & pay CGT in tax return |\n| **Property 2** | HELD | **100% taxable when sold** | Plan sale timing |\n| **Property 3** | HELD | **0% - Fully exempt** | Maintain as main residence |\n| **Property 4** | HELD | **Status unclear** | Clarify purchase date & designation |\n\n---\n\n## COMPLIANCE ISSUES\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **High Priority**:\n\n1. **Property 1 CGT must be reported** in 2022-23 tax return (sold 14/07/2023)\n2. **Main residence designation** must be documented for ATO\n3. **Property 4 information** is incomplete - cannot properly assess\n\n### \ud83d\udccb **ATO Reporting**:\n- Property 1 sale MUST be reported [RULE 5: non-reporting is a key ATO concern]\n- Include main residence exemption calculation in CGT section\n- Keep records for 5 years after sale\n\n---\n\n## FINAL ANSWER: TOTAL CGT LIABILITY\n\n### **Current Realized CGT** (Property 1 only):\n**Cannot calculate exact amount without purchase and sale prices**\n\n**Provide the following for precise calculation**:\n- Property 1 purchase price (2003)\n- Property 1 sale price (2023)\n- Purchase costs (stamp duty, legal fees)\n- Sale costs (agent fees, legal fees)\n- Any improvement costs\n\n**Formula**: \n```\nCGT = [(Sale Price - Purchase Price - Costs) \u00d7 8.9% \u00d7 50%] \u00d7 Your Marginal Tax Rate\n```\n\n### **Future CGT Exposure**:\n- **Property 2**: 100% of gain taxable (with 50% discount)\n- **Property 3**: $0 (fully exempt)\n- **Property 4**: Unknown (requires clarification)\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to calculate the exact CGT liability for Property 1 if you provide the purchase and sale prices?**",

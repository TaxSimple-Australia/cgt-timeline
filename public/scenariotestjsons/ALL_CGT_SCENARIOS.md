## Scenario 2: Six-Year Absence Rule (Within Limit)

### Description

Michael purchases a home, lives in it for 4 years, then moves interstate for work and rents out the property. He sells the property after 5 years of renting. As the rental period is less than 6 years and he chose to treat it as his main residence during absence (and didn't claim another property as main residence), the full exemption applies under the six-year rule.

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Calculate Rental Period
Rent Start: 30 June 2019
Sale Date: 15 August 2024
Rental Period = 1,873 days = 5.13 years
Rental period is LESS than 6 years

Step 2: Six-Year Rule Assessment
Property was main residence before renting: YES
Rental period under 6 years: YES
No other property claimed as main residence: YES
RESULT: Full main residence exemption applies

Step 3: Calculate Capital Gain (for reference)
Sale Price: $1,580,000

Cost Base:

---

## Scenario 3: Six-Year Absence Rule (Exceeded)

### Description

John purchases a home, lives in it for 2 years, then moves overseas and rents it out. He returns and sells the property after 9 years of renting. Since the rental period exceeds 6 years, only the first 6 years of rental are covered by the main residence exemption. The remaining 3 years are subject to CGT, resulting in a partial exemption.

### Key Facts

| 01 Jun 2024 | Sale | $1,250,000 (agent fees: $31,250, legal fees: $2,800) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Apply First Use to Produce Income Rule (s118.192)
Since property was main residence then rented:
Deemed acquisition date: 28 February 2014
Deemed cost base: $480,000 (market value at first rental)

Step 2: Calculate Rental Period
Rent Start: 28 February 2014
Sale Date: 1 June 2024
Total Rental Period = 3,747 days = 10.26 years
Rental period EXCEEDS 6 years by 3.26 years (1,096 days)

Step 3: Calculate Ownership Period (from deemed acquisition)
Deemed Acquisition: 28 February 2014
Sale Date: 1 June 2024
Total Ownership = 3,747 days

Step 4: Calculate Non-Main-Residence Days
Total rental days: 3,747
Six-year exemption: 2,192 days (6 years)
Non-main-residence days: 1,555 days

Step 5: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $1,250,000

Cost Base (from deemed acquisition):
Deemed Acquisition Value: $480,000
Sale Agent Fees: $31,250
Sale Legal Fees: $2,800
Total Cost Base: $514,050

Capital Gain = $1,250,000 - $514,050 = $735,950

Step 6: Apply Partial Main Residence Exemption
Taxable Proportion = Non-MR Days / Total Ownership Days
Taxable Proportion = 1,555 / 3,747 = 41.50%

Taxable Capital Gain = $735,950 x 41.50% = $305,419

Step 7: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $305,419 x 50% = $152,710

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $152,710

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.192: First use to produce income rule (deemed acquisition at market value)
ITAA97 s118.145: Six-year absence rule (partial - exceeded 6 years)
ITAA97 s115.25: 50% CGT discount applies (held > 12 months)

## Scenario 4: Rental First, Then Main Residence

### Description

Emma purchases an investment property and rents it out immediately. After 3 years, she decides to move in and make it her main residence. She lives there for 5 years before selling. Because the property was rented before becoming a main residence, the six-year absence rule does NOT apply. Only the period as main residence is exempt.

### Key Facts

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Property | 256 Collins Street, Melbourne VIC 3000 |
| Purchase Date | 1 February 2016 |
| Purchase Price | $530,000 |
| Rent Period | 1 February 2016 to 10 April 2019 (1,165 days) |
| Move In Date | 10 April 2019 |
| Sale Date | 1 October 2024 |
| Sale Price | $795,000 |
| Total Ownership | 3,166 days |
| Non-Main-Residence Days | 1,165 days (rental period) |

### Timeline of Events

| Date | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 01 Feb 2016 | Purchase | $530,000 + $21,200 stamp duty + $3,200 legal fees |
| 01 Feb 2016 | Rent Start | Rented as investment property |
| 10 Apr 2019 | Rent End | Tenant vacates |
| 10 Apr 2019 | Move In | Owner moves in as main residence |
| 01 Oct 2024 | Sale | $795,000 (agent fees: $19,875, legal fees: $2,400) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Verify Six-Year Rule Eligibility
Property was rented BEFORE being used as main residence
Six-year rule does NOT apply (only applies when main residence first)

Step 2: Calculate Ownership Periods
Total Ownership: 1 Feb 2016 to 1 Oct 2024 = 3,166 days

Rental Period (Non-MR): 1 Feb 2016 to 10 Apr 2019 = 1,165 days
Main Residence Period: 10 Apr 2019 to 1 Oct 2024 = 2,001 days

Step 3: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $795,000

Cost Base:
Purchase Price: $530,000
Stamp Duty: $21,200
Purchase Legal Fees: $3,200
Sale Agent Fees: $19,875
Sale Legal Fees: $2,400
Total Cost Base: $576,675

Capital Gain = $795,000 - $576,675 = $218,325

Step 4: Apply Partial Main Residence Exemption
Taxable Proportion = Non-MR Days / Total Ownership Days
Taxable Proportion = 1,165 / 3,166 = 36.80%

Exempt Proportion = 2,001 / 3,166 = 63.20%
Exempt Amount = $218,325 x 63.20% = $137,981

Taxable Capital Gain = $218,325 x 36.80% = $80,344

Step 5: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $80,344 x 50% = $40,172

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $40,172

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.185: Partial main residence exemption
Six-year rule NOT applicable: Property was investment first, then main residence
ITAA97 s115.25: 50% CGT discount applies

Requirements:
Lived in Property 1 for at least 3 months in past 12 months: YES
Property 1 did not produce income during overlap: YES
Overlap period 6 months or less: YES (165 days = 5.5 months)

RESULT: Both properties treated as main residence during overlap

Step 2: Calculate Main Residence Period for Property 1
Purchase: 1 May 2012
Sale: 15 July 2024
Total Ownership = 4,458 days

Property 1 treated as main residence: ENTIRE period
(Including overlap period under s118.140)

Total Cost Base: $458,400

Capital Gain = $780,000 - $458,400 = $321,600

Step 4: Apply Main Residence Exemption
Under s118.140, both homes treated as main residence for overlap
Property 1 was main residence for entire ownership
Exemption: FULL (100%)

Step 5: Taxable Capital Gain

| 01 Jan 2012 | Purchase | $890,000 + $35,600 stamp duty + $4,200 legal fees |
| 01 Jan 2012 | Move In | Established as main residence |
| 15 Jun 2014 | Improvement | Renovation: $55,000 |
| 01 Jan 2016 | Move Out | Relocated to Singapore for work |
| 01 Jan 2016 | Rent Start | Tenant moves in. Market value: $1,050,000 |
| 01 Sep 2024 | Sale | $2,150,000 (agent fees: $53,750, legal fees: $4,500) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Apply First Use to Produce Income Rule (s118.192)
Since property was main residence then rented:
Deemed acquisition date: 1 January 2016
Deemed cost base: $1,050,000 (market value at first rental)

Step 2: Calculate Rental Period
Rent Start: 1 January 2016
Sale Date: 1 September 2024
Total Rental Period = 3,166 days = 8.67 years
Rental period EXCEEDS 6 years by 2.67 years (975 days)

Step 3: Calculate Ownership Period (from deemed acquisition)
Deemed Acquisition: 1 January 2016
Sale Date: 1 September 2024
Total Ownership = 3,166 days

Step 4: Calculate Non-Main-Residence Days
Total rental days: 3,166
Six-year exemption: 2,192 days (6 years)
Non-main-residence days: 974 days

Step 5: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $2,150,000

Cost Base (from deemed acquisition):
Deemed Acquisition Value: $1,050,000
Sale Agent Fees: $53,750
Sale Legal Fees: $4,500
Total Cost Base: $1,108,250

Capital Gain = $2,150,000 - $1,108,250 = $1,041,750

Step 6: Apply Partial Main Residence Exemption
Taxable Proportion = Non-MR Days / Total Ownership Days
Taxable Proportion = 974 / 3,166 = 30.77%

Taxable Capital Gain = $1,041,750 x 30.77% = $320,546

Step 7: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $320,546 x 50% = $160,273

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $160,273

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.192: First use to produce income rule (deemed acquisition at market value)
ITAA97 s118.145: Six-year absence rule (partial - exceeded 6 years)
ITAA97 s115.25: 50% CGT discount applies (held > 12 months)

## Scenario 9: Rental First (Variant B)

### Description

Nathan purchases an investment property and rents it out immediately. After 4 years, he decides to move in and make it his main residence. He lives there for 6.5 years before selling. Because the property was rented before becoming a main residence, the six-year absence rule does NOT apply. Only the period as main residence is exempt.

### Timeline of Events

| Date | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 01 Apr 2014 | Purchase | $485,000 + $19,400 stamp duty + $2,900 legal fees |
| 01 Apr 2014 | Rent Start | Rented as investment property |

| 01 Oct 2024 | Sale | $875,000 (agent fees: $21,875, legal fees: $2,600) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Verify Six-Year Rule Eligibility
Property was rented BEFORE being used as main residence
Six-year rule does NOT apply (only applies when main residence first)

Step 2: Calculate Ownership Periods
Total Ownership: 1 Apr 2014 to 1 Oct 2024 = 3,836 days

Rental Period (Non-MR): 1 Apr 2014 to 15 May 2018 = 1,505 days
Main Residence Period: 15 May 2018 to 1 Oct 2024 = 2,331 days

Step 3: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $875,000

Cost Base:
Purchase Price: $485,000
Stamp Duty: $19,400
Purchase Legal Fees: $2,900
Renovation: $28,000
Sale Agent Fees: $21,875
Sale Legal Fees: $2,600
Total Cost Base: $559,775

Capital Gain = $875,000 - $559,775 = $315,225

Step 4: Apply Partial Main Residence Exemption
Taxable Proportion = Non-MR Days / Total Ownership Days
Taxable Proportion = 1,505 / 3,836 = 39.23%

Exempt Proportion = 2,331 / 3,836 = 60.77%
Exempt Amount = $315,225 x 60.77% = $191,539

Taxable Capital Gain = $315,225 x 39.23% = $123,686

Step 5: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $123,686 x 50% = $61,843

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $61,843

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.185: Partial main residence exemption
Six-year rule NOT applicable: Property was investment first, then main residence
ITAA97 s115.25: 50% CGT discount applies

### CGT Calculation - Property 1

Step 1: Verify 6-Month Overlap Rule Eligibility (s118.140)
Requirements:
Lived in Property 1 for at least 3 months in past 12 months: YES
Property 1 did not produce income during overlap: YES
Overlap period 6 months or less: YES (137 days = 4.5 months)

RESULT: Both properties treated as main residence during overlap

Step 2: Calculate Main Residence Period for Property 1
Purchase: 1 July 2010
Sale: 15 August 2024
Total Ownership = 5,159 days

Property 1 treated as main residence: ENTIRE period
(Including overlap period under s118.140)

Step 3: Calculate Capital Gain (for reference)
Sale Price: $980,000

Cost Base:
Purchase Price: $510,000
Stamp Duty: $17,850
Purchase Legal Fees: $2,800
Major Renovation: $85,000
Sale Agent Fees: $24,500
Sale Legal Fees: $2,400
Total Cost Base: $642,550

Capital Gain = $980,000 - $642,550 = $337,450

Step 4: Apply Main Residence Exemption
Under s118.140, both homes treated as main residence for overlap
Property 1 was main residence for entire ownership
Exemption: FULL (100%)

Step 5: Taxable Capital Gain
Taxable Amount = $0 (FULLY EXEMPT)

RESULT: NO CGT PAYABLE

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.140: Moving between main residences (6-month overlap rule)
Both properties can be main residence for up to 6 months during transition
Overlap of 4.5 months is within allowable period

| 28 Feb 2025 | Sale | $2,850,000 |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Calculate Total Rental Period
First rental: 1 Jan 1996 to 31 Dec 2000 = 1,827 days
Second rental: 1 Mar 2001 to 28 Feb 2003 = 730 days
Total rental = 2,557 days = 7 years

Step 2: Apply Six-Year Rule
Six-year exemption covers: 2,192 days
Excess beyond six years: 2,557 - 2,192 = 365 days

Step 3: Calculate Taxable Proportion
Total ownership: 11,201 days
Non-main-residence days: 365 days

Taxable Proportion = 365 / 11,201 = 3.26%
Exempt Proportion = 96.74%

Step 4: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $2,850,000
Cost Base (estimated): $400,000

Capital Gain = $2,850,000 - $400,000 = $2,450,000

Step 5: Apply Partial Exemption
Taxable Capital Gain = $2,450,000 x 3.26% = $79,870

Step 6: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Discounted Gain = $79,870 x 50% = $39,935

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $39,935

### Applicable Rules

| 31 Oct 2024 | Sale | $950,000 (agent fees: $23,750, legal fees: $2,800) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Determine Cost Base
Property was deceased's main residence
Cost base = Market value at death = $780,000

Step 2: Check 2-Year Disposal Rule
Death date: 15 August 2020
Sale date: 31 October 2024
Time since death: 4.2 years
2-year rule does NOT apply (sold after 2 years)

Step 3: Calculate Ownership Period (Emma)
From death: 15 Aug 2020 to 31 Oct 2024 = 1,538 days
Entire period was rental (no MRE for Emma)

Step 4: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $950,000

Cost Base:
Market Value at Death: $780,000
Sale Agent Fees: $23,750
Sale Legal Fees: $2,800

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Verify Six-Year Rule Eligibility
Property was rented BEFORE being used as main residence
Six-year rule does NOT apply

Step 2: Calculate Ownership Periods
Total Ownership: 1 Feb 2014 to 30 Nov 2024 = 3,955 days

First Rental (Non-MR): 1,261 days
Main Residence: 1,144 days
Second Rental (Non-MR): 1,538 days

Total Non-MR days: 1,261 + 1,538 = 2,799 days

Step 3: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $580,000

Cost Base:
Purchase Price: $385,000
Stamp Duty: $15,400
Purchase Legal Fees: $2,200
Sale Agent Fees: $14,500
Sale Legal Fees: $2,000
Total Cost Base: $419,100

Capital Gain = $580,000 - $419,100 = $160,900

Step 4: Apply Partial Main Residence Exemption
Taxable Proportion = Non-MR Days / Total Ownership Days
Taxable Proportion = 2,799 / 3,955 = 70.77%

Exempt Proportion = 1,144 / 3,955 = 28.93%

Taxable Capital Gain = $160,900 x 70.77% = $113,869

Step 5: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $113,869 x 50% = $56,935

|------|-------|---------|
| 01 Feb 2024 | Purchase | $1,200,000 + stamp duty + legal fees |
| 01 Feb 2024 | Move In | Established as main residence |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Calculate Overlap Excess
Overlap period: 1 Feb 2024 to 15 Oct 2024 = 257 days
6-month allowance: 183 days
Excess: 257 - 183 = 74 days

One property must lose exemption for 74 days
Choose old home (smaller proportion of ownership)

Step 2: Calculate Taxable Proportion
Total ownership (old home): 4,611 days
Non-exempt days: 74 days

Taxable Proportion = 74 / 4,611 = 1.60%
Exempt Proportion = 98.40%

Step 3: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $1,450,000

Cost Base:
Purchase Price: $720,000
Stamp Duty: $28,800
Purchase Legal Fees: $3,500
Sale Agent Fees: $36,250
Sale Legal Fees: $3,200
Total Cost Base: $791,750

Capital Gain = $1,450,000 - $791,750 = $658,250

Step 4: Apply Partial Exemption
Taxable Capital Gain = $658,250 x 1.60% = $10,532

Step 5: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $10,532 x 50% = $5,266

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $5,266

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.140: 6-month overlap rule
Overlap of 257 days exceeds 183-day limit by 74 days
Must choose which property loses exemption for excess period
Old home loses exemption for 74 days (smaller proportion)

| Property | 22 Birdwood Street, Auchenflower QLD 4066 |
| Purchase Date | 1 April 2016 |
| Purchase Price | $520,000 |
| Airbnb Start | 1 January 2019 |
| Airbnb End | 31 December 2023 |
| Sale Date | 15 August 2024 |

| Total Floor Area | 180 sqm |
| Rented Room (Exclusive) | 18 sqm |
| Shared Areas | 45 sqm |
| Airbnb Period | 1,826 days |
| Total Ownership | 3,059 days |

### Timeline of Events

| Date | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 01 Apr 2016 | Purchase | $520,000 + $20,800 stamp duty + $2,600 legal fees |
| 01 Apr 2016 | Move In | Established as main residence |

| 15 Aug 2024 | Sale | $850,000 (agent fees: $21,250, legal fees: $2,400) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Calculate Income-Producing Proportion
Interest deductibility test applies (s118.190)

Exclusive rented area: 18 / 180 = 10%
Shared area proportion: (45 / 180) x 50% = 12.5%
Total income-producing floor area: 10% + 12.5% = 22.5%

Step 2: Calculate Time Proportion
Airbnb period: 1,826 days
Total ownership: 3,059 days
Time proportion: 1,826 / 3,059 = 59.69%

Step 3: Calculate Taxable Proportion
Taxable = Floor Area % x Time %
Taxable = 22.5% x 59.69% = 13.43%
Exempt = 86.57%

Step 4: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $850,000

Cost Base:
Purchase Price: $520,000
Stamp Duty: $20,800
Purchase Legal Fees: $2,600
Sale Agent Fees: $21,250
Sale Legal Fees: $2,400
Total Cost Base: $567,050

Capital Gain = $850,000 - $567,050 = $282,950

Step 5: Apply Partial Exemption
Taxable Capital Gain = $282,950 x 13.43% = $38,002

Step 6: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $38,002 x 50% = $19,001

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $19,001

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.190: Interest deductibility test applies
Floor area apportionment required
Time apportionment for rental period
Taxable proportion = 22.5% x 59.69% = 13.43%
ITAA97 s115.25: 50% CGT discount applies

### Timeline of Events

Alex's Property

| Date | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 01 Jul 2015 | Purchase | $580,000 + $23,200 stamp duty + $2,900 legal fees |
| 01 Jul 2015 | Move In | Established as main residence |

|------|-------|---------|
| 15 Jan 2017 | Purchase | $650,000 + stamp duty + legal fees |
| 15 Jan 2017 | Move In | Sam's main residence |
| 01 Mar 2020 | Alex Move In | Couple cohabits, joint main residence |

### CGT Calculation - Alex's Property

Step 1: Determine Main Residence Periods
Alex's main residence: 1 Jul 2015 to 1 Mar 2020 = 1,705 days
Non-main residence (after cohabitation): 1 Mar 2020 to 15 Sep 2024 = 1,660 days

Note: Couple claimed Sam's property as joint main residence from 1 March 2020

Step 2: Calculate Proportions
Total ownership: 3,365 days
Main residence days: 1,705 days
Non-main residence days: 1,660 days

Exempt Proportion = 1,705 / 3,365 = 50.67%
Taxable Proportion = 1,660 / 3,365 = 49.33%

Step 3: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $920,000

Cost Base:
Purchase Price: $580,000
Stamp Duty: $23,200
Purchase Legal Fees: $2,900
Sale Agent Fees: $23,000
Sale Legal Fees: $2,600
Total Cost Base: $631,700

Capital Gain = $920,000 - $631,700 = $288,300

Step 4: Apply Partial Exemption
Taxable Capital Gain = $288,300 x 49.33% = $142,214

Step 5: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $142,214 x 50% = $71,107

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $71,107

### Applicable Rules

From cohabitation date (1 Mar 2020), couple can only claim ONE main residence
Alex's property was no longer main residence after moving in with Sam
Couple claimed Sam's property as joint main residence
ITAA97 s118.185: Partial exemption applies
ITAA97 s115.25: 50% CGT discount applies

| 15 Nov 2024 | Sale | $810,000 (agent fees: $20,250, legal fees: $2,300) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Check Six-Year Rule Eligibility
Rental period: 1 Jul 2018 to 30 Jun 2022 = 4 years
Six-year rule applies (rental < 6 years)
Full main residence exemption available

Step 2: Check Foreign Resident Impact
Lisa was Australian resident at time of sale
Foreign resident period: 4 years
Australian resident period: 7.3 years

Since she returned BEFORE selling:
Full MRE can be claimed
CGT discount reduced for foreign resident period

Step 3: Calculate CGT Discount Reduction
Standard discount: 50%
Australian resident proportion: 7.3 / 11.3 = 64.6%
Reduced discount: 50% x 64.6% = 32.3%

Step 4: Calculate Capital Gain (for reference)
Sale Price: $810,000

Cost Base:
Purchase Price: $495,000
Stamp Duty: $19,800
Purchase Legal Fees: $2,400
Sale Agent Fees: $20,250
Sale Legal Fees: $2,300
Total Cost Base: $539,750

Capital Gain = $810,000 - $539,750 = $270,250

Step 5: Apply Main Residence Exemption
Six-year rule applies (rental 4 years < 6 years)
Exemption: FULL (100%)

Step 6: Taxable Capital Gain
Taxable Amount = $0 (FULLY EXEMPT)

RESULT: NO CGT PAYABLE

Note: CGT discount reduction would only apply if there was a taxable gain

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.145: Six-year absence rule applies (rental < 6 years)
Returned to Australia BEFORE selling = Can claim full MRE
CGT discount reduced for foreign resident period (if taxable)
Since full MRE applies, no CGT payable

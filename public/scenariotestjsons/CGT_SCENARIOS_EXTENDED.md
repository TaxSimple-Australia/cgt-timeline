## Scenario 1: Aged Care Entry with Indefinite Absence

### Description

Margaret purchases her home and lives in it for 20 years before entering permanent aged care. She leaves the property vacant (not rented) for 7 years while in aged care before selling. Because the property was not used to produce income during her absence, she can treat it as her main residence indefinitely under s118.145.

### Key Facts

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Property | 15 Magnolia Street, Toowoomba QLD 4350 |
| Purchase Date | 1 March 2000 |
| Purchase Price | $185,000 |
| Aged Care Entry | 1 April 2017 |
| Property Status During Absence | Vacant (not rented) |
| Sale Date | 15 August 2024 |
| Sale Price | $520,000 |
| Total Ownership | 8,934 days (24 years, 5.5 months) |
| Main Residence Days | 8,934 days (100%) |

### Timeline of Events

| Date | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 01 Mar 2000 | Purchase | $185,000 + $5,550 stamp duty + $1,200 legal fees |

| 15 Aug 2024 | Sale | $520,000 (agent fees: $13,000, legal fees: $1,800) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Verify Indefinite Absence Rule Eligibility
Property was main residence before absence: YES
Property used to produce income during absence: NO
No other property claimed as main residence: YES
RESULT: Can treat as main residence indefinitely

Step 2: Calculate Capital Gain (for reference)
Sale Price: $520,000

Cost Base:
Purchase Price: $185,000
Stamp Duty: $5,550
Purchase Legal Fees: $1,200
Kitchen Renovation: $25,000
Sale Agent Fees: $13,000
Sale Legal Fees: $1,800
Total Cost Base: $231,550

Capital Gain = $520,000 - $231,550 = $288,450

Step 3: Apply Main Residence Exemption
Under s118.145, property continues to be treated as main residence
Property not used to produce income = indefinite exemption
Exemption: FULL (100%)

Step 4: Taxable Capital Gain
Taxable Amount = $0 (FULLY EXEMPT)

RESULT: NO CGT PAYABLE

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.145: Indefinite absence rule applies (property not income producing)
Property can be treated as main residence indefinitely when not rented
No limit on how long the property can be vacant
Full exemption applies regardless of 7+ years in aged care

## Scenario 3: Multiple Six-Year Periods Reset

### Description

Rebecca purchases a home, lives in it for 5 years, rents it out for 4 years while working overseas, moves back in for 2 years, then rents it again for 5 years before selling. Because she genuinely moved back in and re-established the property as her main residence, she is entitled to a new 6-year period for the second rental. The full main residence exemption applies.

### Key Facts

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Verify Six-Year Rule Reset
First rental period: 4 years (within 6-year limit)
Genuinely moved back and re-established as main residence: YES
Second rental period: 5 years (within NEW 6-year limit)
RESULT: Both rental periods covered by six-year rule

Step 2: Calculate Total Rental

## Scenario 4: Deceased Estate Sold Within Two Years

### Description

William's mother passes away and leaves him her home, which was her main residence. William sells the property within 2 years of her death. Because the property was the deceased's main residence and was sold within 2 years, William is entitled to a full CGT exemption under the deceased estate provisions.

### Key Facts

| 01 Feb 2025 | Sale | $510,000 (agent fees: $12,750, legal fees: $2,000) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Verify 2-Year Disposal Rule Eligibility (s118.195)
Property was deceased's main residence: YES
Property sold within 2 years of death: YES (688 days < 730 days)
Property not used to produce income since death: YES (vacant)
RESULT: Full CGT exemption applies

Step 2: Calculate Capital Gain (for reference)
Sale Price: $510,000
Market Value at Death (Cost Base): $485,000

Cost Base:
Market Value at Death: $485,000
Sale Agent Fees: $12,750
Sale Legal Fees: $2,000
Total Cost Base: $499,750

Capital Gain = $510,000 - $499,750 = $10,250

Step 3: Apply Deceased Estate Exemption
2-year disposal rule applies
Deceased's main residence exemption extends to beneficiary
Exemption: FULL (100%)

Step 4: Taxable Capital Gain
Taxable Amount = $0 (FULLY EXEMPT)

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.195: 2-year disposal rule
Property was deceased's main residence at time of death
Sold within 2 years = Full exemption (regardless of whether beneficiary lived there)
William did not need to move in to claim exemption
Note: If sold after 2 years, partial exemption may apply (see Scenario 5)

---

## Scenario 5: Beneficiary Moves Into Inherited Property

### Description

Sarah inherits her father's investment property (which was NOT his main residence). She moves into the property as her main residence for 4 years before selling. Because the property was not the deceased's main residence, Sarah cannot use the 2-year rule. However, she can claim the main residence exemption for the period she lived there.

### Key Facts

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Property | 120 Investment Crescent, Mackay QLD 4740 |
| Father's Purchase Date | 15 June 2010 |
| Father's Purchase Price | $320,000 |
| Death Date | 1 August 2020 |
| Market Value at Death | $395,000 |
| Sarah Move In | 1 October 2020 |
| Sale Date | 30 September 2024 |
| Sale Price | $480,000 |
| Sarah's Ownership | 1,521 days (4.2 years) |
| Sarah's Main Residence Period | 1,461 days (4 years) |

### Timeline of Events

| Date | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 15 Jun 2010 | Father's Purchase | $320,000 (used as investment property) |
| 01 Aug 2020 | Death | Father passes. Market value: $395,000 |
| 15 Sep 2020 | Transfer | Sarah receives property as beneficiary |
| 01 Oct 2020 | Move In | Sarah moves in as main residence |
| 30 Sep 2024 | Sale | $480,000 (agent fees: $12,000, legal fees: $1,900) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Determine Cost Base
Property was NOT deceased's main residence (investment property)
Cost base = Father's original cost base + capital improvements
Cost base for Sarah = $320,000 (original purchase)
Note: Stamp duty and purchase costs from 2010 would be added

Estimated Total Cost Base from Father: $345,000

Step 2: Check 2-Year Disposal Rule
Property was NOT deceased's main residence: Does NOT apply
Sarah must use standard main residence rules

Step 3: Calculate Ownership Periods
Sarah's total ownership: 15 Sep 2020 to 30 Sep 2024 = 1,476 days
Vacant period (before move in): 15 Sep 2020 to 1 Oct 2020 = 16 days
Main residence period: 1 Oct 2020 to 30 Sep 2024 = 1,461 days

Step 4: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $480,000

Cost Base:
Father's Cost Base: $345,000
Sale Agent Fees: $12,000
Sale Legal Fees: $1,900
Total Cost Base: $358,900

Capital Gain = $480,000 - $358,900 = $121,100

Step 5: Apply Partial Main Residence Exemption
Taxable Proportion = Non-MR Days / Total Ownership Days
Taxable Proportion = 16 / 1,476 = 1.08%

Exempt Proportion = 1,461 / 1,476 = 98.98%

Taxable Capital Gain = $121,100 x 1.08% = $1,308

Step 6: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months from date of death: YES
Discounted Gain = $1,308 x 50% = $654

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $654

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.195: 2-year rule NOT applicable (property was NOT deceased's main residence)
Sarah inherits father's cost base and acquisition date
ITAA97 s118.185: Partial main residence exemption for period Sarah lived there
Small taxable portion due to 16-day delay before moving in
ITAA97 s115.25: 50% CGT discount applies

## Scenario 6: Pre-CGT Property with Major Post-CGT Improvements

### Description

George purchased a property in 1982 (before CGT commenced on 20 September 1985). In 2015, he undertook a major renovation costing $250,000. He sells the property in 2024. While the original property is exempt as a pre-CGT asset, the major capital improvement is a separate CGT asset and may be taxable.

### Key Facts

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Property | 78 Colonial Road, Bundaberg QLD 4670 |
| Purchase Date | 1 June 1982 (Pre-CGT) |
| Purchase Price | $42,000 |
| Major Renovation Date | 1 March 2015 |
| Renovation Cost | $250,000 |
| Sale Date | 15 October 2024 |
| Sale Price | $680,000 |
| Portion Attributable to Improvement | $300,000 (valuer estimate) |

### Timeline of Events

| Date | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 01 Jun 1982 | Purchase | $42,000 (Pre-CGT asset) |
| 01 Jun 1982 | Move In | Established as main residence |
| 01 Mar 2015 | Major Renovation | Complete house renovation: $250,000 |
| 15 Oct 2024 | Sale | $680,000 (agent fees: $17,000, legal fees: $2,500) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Identify Pre-CGT vs Post-CGT Assets
Original property: Acquired 1 June 1982 = PRE-CGT (exempt)
Major renovation: Completed 1 March 2015 = POST-CGT (potentially taxable)

Step 2: Determine if Improvement is "Major Capital Improvement"
Renovation cost: $250,000
5% of sale price: $680,000 x 5% = $34,000
2024-25 threshold: $182,665

Test 1: $250,000 > $34,000 (5% of proceeds)? YES
Test 2: $250,000 > $182,665 (threshold)? YES
RESULT: Renovation is a major capital improvement (separate CGT asset)

Step 3: Check Main Residence Exemption
Property was main residence for entire ownership period: YES
Improvement used as part of home: YES
RESULT: Improvement also exempt under main residence exemption

Step 4: Calculate Capital Gain on Improvement (for reference)
Portion of sale attributable to improvement: $300,000
Cost base of improvement: $250,000
Capital Gain on improvement = $300,000 - $250,000 = $50,000

Step 5: Apply Main Residence Exemption to Improvement
Improvement was part of main residence
ITAA97 s108.70: Improvements on MR are exempt if used as part of home
Exemption: FULL (100%)

Step 6: Taxable Capital Gain
Taxable Amount = $0 (FULLY EXEMPT)

RESULT: NO CGT PAYABLE

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s149.10: Pre-CGT assets (acquired before 20 September 1985) exempt
ITAA97 s108.70: Major capital improvements are separate CGT assets
Major improvement threshold 2024-25: >5% of proceeds AND >$182,665
ITAA97 s118.110: Main residence exemption extends to improvements used as part of home
Note: If property was NOT main residence, improvement would be taxable

## Scenario 7: Large Rural Property Exceeding Two Hectares

### Description

Patricia owns a 5-hectare rural property where she has lived for 15 years. The main residence exemption only applies to the dwelling and up to 2 hectares of adjacent land used for private purposes. She must choose which 2 hectares to include, with the remaining 3 hectares subject to CGT.

### Key Facts

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Property | 450 Mountain View Road, Atherton QLD 4883 |
| Purchase Date | 1 January 2010 |
| Purchase Price | $420,000 |
| Total Land Size | 5 hectares |
| Exempt Land | 2 hectares (dwelling + adjacent) |
| Taxable Land | 3 hectares |
| Sale Date | 15 December 2024 |
| Sale Price | $1,200,000 |
| Value of Dwelling + 2ha | $720,000 (60%) |
| Value of Remaining 3ha | $480,000 (40%) |

### Timeline of Events

| Date | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 01 Jan 2010 | Purchase | $420,000 + $14,700 stamp duty + $3,000 legal fees (5 hectares) |
| 01 Jan 2010 | Move In | Established as main residence |
| 15 Jun 2015 | Improvement | Shed construction: $35,000 (on exempt 2ha) |
| 15 Dec 2024 | Sale | $1,200,000 (agent fees: $30,000, legal fees: $4,000) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Determine Exempt vs Taxable Portions
Total land: 5 hectares
Maximum exempt adjacent land: 2 hectares
Taxable land: 5 - 2 = 3 hectares

Step 2: Allocate Sale Proceeds
Total sale price: $1,200,000
Exempt portion (dwelling + 2ha): $720,000 (60%)
Taxable portion (remaining 3ha): $480,000 (40%)

Step 3: Allocate Cost Base
Total purchase: $420,000
Total costs: $420,000 + $14,700 + $3,000 = $437,700

Exempt cost base (60%): $262,620
Taxable cost base (40%): $175,080

Step 4: Allocate Sale Costs
Total sale costs: $30,000 + $4,000 = $34,000
Exempt sale costs (60%): $20,400
Taxable sale costs (40%): $13,600

Step 5: Calculate Capital Gain on Taxable Portion
Taxable proceeds: $480,000
Taxable cost base: $175,080 + $13,600 = $188,680

Capital Gain = $480,000 - $188,680 = $291,320

Step 6: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $291,320 x 50% = $145,660

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $145,660

### Applicable Rules

| 31 Dec 2024 | Sale | $680,000 (agent fees: $17,000, legal fees: $2,500) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Calculate Income-Producing Proportion
Interest deductibility test applies (s118.190)
Business use floor area: 15%
Business use period: 2,557 days / 3,287 days = 77.79%

Step 2: Calculate Taxable Proportion
Taxable = Floor Area % x Time %
Taxable = 15% x 77.79% = 11.67%
Exempt = 88.33%

Step 3: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $680,000

Cost Base:
Purchase Price: $420,000
Stamp Duty: $14,700
Purchase Legal Fees: $2,800
Sale Agent Fees: $17,000
Sale Legal Fees: $2,500
Total Cost Base: $457,000

Capital Gain = $680,000 - $457,000 = $223,000

Step 4: Apply Partial Exemption
Taxable Capital Gain = $223,000 x 11.67% = $26,024

Exempt Amount = $223,000 x 88.33% = $196,976

Step 5: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $26,024 x 50% = $13,012

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $13,012

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.190: Interest deductibility test
Part of home used for income-producing purposes (business)
Taxable proportion = Floor area % x Time proportion
Business use of 15% for 77.79% of ownership = 11.67% taxable
ITAA97 s115.25: 50% CGT discount applies to taxable portion
Note: Different from Airbnb room rental - this is exclusive business use

| 15 Oct 2024 | Sale | $880,000 (agent fees: $22,000, legal fees: $3,200) |

### CGT Calculation - Chris's Property

Step 1: Identify Periods
Total ownership: 1 Feb 2018 to 15 Oct 2024 = 2,448 days

Period 1: Joint main residence
1 Feb 2018 to 15 Mar 2019 = 407 days
Chris's exemption: 100%

Period 2: Different main residences (spouses apart)
15 Mar 2019 to 15 Oct 2024 = 2,041 days
Chris owns 100% of property (not 50% or less)
Exemption: 50% of this period (s118.170)

Step 2: Calculate Exempt Days
Period 1: 407 days x 100% = 407 exempt days
Period 2: 2,041 days x 50% = 1,020.5 exempt days
Total exempt days: 1,427.5 days

Step 3: Calculate Taxable Proportion
Total ownership: 2,448 days
Exempt days: 1,427.5 days
Non-exempt days: 1,020.5 days

Taxable Proportion = 1,020.5 / 2,448 = 41.69%
Exempt Proportion = 58.31%

Step 4: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $880,000

Cost Base:
Purchase Price: $620,000
Stamp Duty: $24,800
Purchase Legal Fees: $3,800
Sale Agent Fees: $22,000
Sale Legal Fees: $3,200
Total Cost Base: $673,800

Capital Gain = $880,000 - $673,800 = $206,200

Step 5: Apply Partial Exemption
Taxable Capital Gain = $206,200 x 41.69% = $85,964

Step 6: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $85,964 x 50% = $42,982

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $42,982

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.170: Spouses living in different main residences
If spouse owns >50% of nominated dwelling, exemption = 50% for period living apart
Chris owns 100%, so only 50% exemption applies during different MR period
If Chris owned 50% or less, would get 100% exemption on their share
ITAA97 s115.25: 50% CGT discount applies

| 31 Dec 2024 | Sale | $520,000 (agent fees: $13,000, legal fees: $2,000) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Calculate Total Income-Producing Period
Rental period: 1 Jan 2016 to 31 Dec 2024 = 3,287 days (9 years)
Vacant periods (between tenants): 5 months = 152 days
Note: Vacant periods while available for rent COUNT towards 6-year limit

Total income-producing period: 3,287 days (includes vacant periods)

Step 2: Apply First Use to Produce Income Rule
Property was main residence then rented
Deemed acquisition: 1 January 2016
Deemed cost base: Market value at first rental

Estimated market value at 1 Jan 2016: $340,000

Step 3: Calculate Non-Main-Residence Days
Total rental period from deemed acquisition: 3,287 days
Six-year exemption: 2,192 days
Excess beyond six years: 1,095 days (3 years)

Step 4: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $520,000

Cost Base (from deemed acquisition):
Deemed Value: $340,000
Sale Agent Fees: $13,000
Sale Legal Fees: $2,000
Total Cost Base: $355,000

Capital Gain = $520,000 - $355,000 = $165,000

Step 5: Apply Partial Exemption
Taxable Proportion = Non-MR Days / Total Ownership (from deemed)
Taxable Proportion = 1,095 / 3,287 = 33.31%

Taxable Capital Gain = $165,000 x 33.31% = $54,962

Step 6: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $54,962 x 50% = $27,481

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $27,481

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.145: Six-year absence rule exceeded
Vacant periods while property available for rent count towards 6-year limit
Only genuinely taking property off rental market stops the clock
ITAA97 s118.192: First use to produce income rule
50% CGT discount applies to taxable portion
Rental period (9 years including vacant) exceeds 6 years by 3 years

Sale Agent Fees: $17,000
Sale Legal Fees: $2,500
Total Cost Base: $495,500

Capital Gain = $680,000 - $495,500 = $184,500

Step 5: Apply Partial Exemption
Taxable Proportion = Non-MR Days / Total Ownership Days
Taxable Proportion = 365 / 2,525 = 14.46%

Taxable Capital Gain = $184,500 x 14.46% = $26,679convergence

Step 6: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $26,679 x 50% = $13,340

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $13,340

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.150: 4-year construction rule
If construction exceeds 4 years, MRE only applies for 4 years before completion
Land was not MR for first year (excess beyond 4-year limit)
ITAA97 s118.185: Partial exemption applies
14.46% of gain is taxable (first year of land ownership)
ITAA97 s115.25: 50% CGT discount applies

## Scenario 16: Subdivision and Separate Land Sale

### Description

Karen owns a large block with her main residence. She subdivides and sells the vacant block separately from the dwelling. Because the vacant block is sold separately, it is NOT eligible for the main residence exemption, even though the dwelling block remains exempt.

### Key Facts

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Original Property | 100 Farmview Road, Kingaroy QLD 4610 |
| Purchase Date | 1 March 2010 |
| Purchase Price | $320,000 |
| Total Land Size | 1.5 hectares (originally) |
| Subdivision Date | 1 June 2022 |
| Lot 1 (Dwelling) | 0.8 hectares |
| Lot 2 (Vacant) | 0.7 hectares |
| Lot 2 Sale Date | 15 September 2024 |
| Lot 2 Sale Price | $180,000 |

### Timeline of Events

| Date | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 01 Mar 2010 | Purchase | $320,000 + $11,200 stamp duty + $2,500 legal fees |
| 01 Mar 2010 | Move In | Established as main residence |
| 01 Jun 2022 | Subdivision | Property divided into Lot 1 and Lot 2 |
| 15 Sep 2024 | Lot 2 Sale | Vacant block sold for $180,000 |

### CGT Calculation - Lot 2 (Vacant Block)

Step 1: Determine CGT Status of Subdivided Block
Vacant block sold separately from dwelling: YES
ITAA97 s118.165: Vacant land NOT exempt when sold separately

Step 2: Allocate Original Cost Base
Original purchase: $320,000
Lot 2 proportion: 0.7ha / 1.5ha = 46.67%

Lot 2 allocated cost: $320,000 x 46.67% = $149,344

Step 3: Allocate Acquisition Costs
Stamp Duty: $11,200 x 46.67% = $5,227
Legal Fees: $2,500 x 46.67% = $1,167
Subdivision costs (2022): $8,000 (100% to Lot 2)

Step 4: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $180,000

Cost Base:
Allocated Purchase: $149,344
Allocated Stamp Duty: $5,227
Allocated Legal Fees: $1,167
Subdivision Costs: $8,000
Sale Agent Fees: $4,500
Sale Legal Fees: $1,200
Total Cost Base: $169,438

Capital Gain = $180,000 - $169,438 = $10,562

Step 5: Apply Main Residence Exemption
Vacant block sold separately from dwelling
MRE does NOT apply to Lot 2

Step 6: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $10,562 x 50% = $5,281

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN (Lot 2) = $5,281

Note: Lot 1 (Dwelling Block)

If Lot 1 sold, full MRE applies (lived in entire period)
Lot 1 would have no CGT liability

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.165: Subdivided vacant land NOT exempt when sold separately
Vacant block is treated as separate CGT asset from subdivision date
Original cost base must be apportioned between lots
If sold together with dwelling, full MRE would apply to both lots
ITAA97 s115.25: 50% CGT discount applies to vacant block

| Sale Price | $380,000 |
| Days Since Death | 1,234 days (3.4 years) |

### Timeline of Events

| Date | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 01 Jan 2005 | Mother's Purchase | Property was mother's main residence |
| 15 Mar 2020 | Death | Mother passes. Market value: $320,000 |
| 01 Jun 2020 | Transfer | Peter receives property as beneficiary |

| 01 Aug 2023 | Sale | $380,000 (agent fees: $9,500, legal fees: $1,800) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Check Standard 2-Year Rule
Death date: 15 March 2020
Sale date: 1 August 2023
Days since death: 1,234 days (3.4 years)
Standard 2-year rule: EXCEEDED

Step 2: Check COVID Extension Eligibility
PCG 2019/5: Automatic extension for qualifying circumstances
COVID-19 government restrictions on real estate: YES
Duration of restrictions: 22 months (>12 months)
Within first 2 years after death: YES
RESULT: Automatic extension applies

Step 3: Verify Extension Conditions Met
Property was deceased's main residence: YES
Peter disposed after restrictions lifted: YES
Delay was due to qualifying circumstance: YES (COVID restrictions)
RESULT: Full CGT exemption applies

Step 4: Calculate Capital Gain (for reference)
Sale Price: $380,000
Market Value at Death: $320,000

Cost Base:
Market Value at Death: $320,000
Sale Agent Fees: $9,500
Sale Legal Fees: $1,800
Total Cost Base: $331,300

Capital Gain = $380,000 - $331,300 = $48,700

Step 5: Apply Extended 2-Year Rule
COVID extension applies
Deceased estate exemption: FULL (100%)

Step 6: Taxable Capital Gain
Taxable Amount = $0 (FULLY EXEMPT)

RESULT: NO CGT PAYABLE

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.195: 2-year disposal rule
PCG 2019/5: Automatic extension for qualifying circumstances
COVID-19 restrictions = Qualifying circumstance
More than 12 months of delay within first 2 years = Automatic extension
Peter did not need to apply for extension
If COVID extension didn't apply, partial exemption would calculate from date of death

## Scenario 19: Investment Property Becomes Main Residence Then Sold

### Description

Amanda purchases an investment property and rents it out for 3 years. She then moves in and lives there as her main residence for 2 years before selling. The six-year absence rule does NOT apply because the property was an investment first. Only the period as main residence qualifies for exemption.

### Key Facts

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Property | 88 Investor Lane, Emerald QLD 4720 |
| Purchase Date | 1 March 2019 |
| Purchase Price | $295,000 |
| Rental Period | 1 Mar 2019 to 28 Feb 2022 (3 years) |
| Move In Date | 1 March 2022 |
| Sale Date | 28 February 2024 |
| Sale Price | $420,000 |
| Total Ownership | 1,826 days (5 years) |

### Timeline of Events

| Date | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 01 Mar 2019 | Purchase | $295,000 + $8,850 stamp duty + $2,200 legal fees |
| 01 Mar 2019 | Rent Start | Immediately rented as investment |
| 28 Feb 2022 | Rent End | Tenant vacates |
| 01 Mar 2022 | Move In | Amanda moves in as main residence |
| 28 Feb 2024 | Sale | $420,000 (agent fees: $10,500, legal fees: $1,900) |

### CGT Calculation

Step 1: Verify Six-Year Rule Eligibility
Property was rented BEFORE becoming main residence: YES
Six-year rule does NOT apply (only applies when MR first)

Step 2: Calculate Ownership Periods
Total Ownership: 1,826 days

Rental Period (Non-MR): 1 Mar 2019 to 28 Feb 2022 = 1,096 days
Main Residence Period: 1 Mar 2022 to 28 Feb 2024 = 730 days

Step 3: Calculate Capital Gain
Sale Price: $420,000

Cost Base:
Purchase Price: $295,000
Stamp Duty: $8,850
Purchase Legal Fees: $2,200
Sale Agent Fees: $10,500
Sale Legal Fees: $1,900
Total Cost Base: $318,450

Capital Gain = $420,000 - $318,450 = $101,550

Step 4: Apply Partial Main Residence Exemption
Taxable Proportion = Non-MR Days / Total Ownership Days
Taxable Proportion = 1,096 / 1,826 = 60.02%

Exempt Proportion = 730 / 1,826 = 39.98%
Exempt Amount = $101,550 x 39.98% = $40,600

Taxable Capital Gain = $101,550 x 60.02% = $60,950

Step 5: Apply 50% CGT Discount
Held > 12 months: YES
Discounted Gain = $60,950 x 50% = $30,475

RESULT: NET CAPITAL GAIN = $30,475

### Applicable Rules

ITAA97 s118.185: Partial main residence exemption
Six-year rule NOT applicable: Property was investment first, then main residence
Only actual residence period (39.98%) is exempt
Rental period (60.02%) is taxable
ITAA97 s115.25: 50% CGT discount applies
Key distinction: If MR first then rental, six-year rule would apply

## Scenario 20: Four Property Portfolio Optimization

### Description

Victoria is selling her entire property portfolio in the 2024-25 financial year: her family home (main residence), a beach house (former main residence now rented), an investment unit (never lived in), and an inherited farm (from deceased parent). Strategic MRE nomination is critical to minimize total CGT.

### Key Facts

Property A - Family Home (Current Main Residence)

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Address | 45 Residence Court, Noosa QLD 4567 |
| Purchase Date | 1 March 2016 |
| Purchase Price | $680,000 |
| Status | Current main residence (lived in 8.8 years) |
| Sale Date | 15 November 2024 |
| Sale Price | $1,450,000 |
| Capital Gain | $680,000 (approximately) |

Property B - Beach House (Former Main Residence)

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Address | 28 Oceanview Drive, Coolum QLD 4573 |
| Purchase Date | 1 June 2012 |
| Purchase Price | $420,000 |
| Lived In Period | 1 Jun 2012 to 28 Feb 2016 (3.75 years) |
| Rental Period | 1 Mar 2016 to 15 Oct 2024 (8.6 years) |
| Sale Date | 15 October 2024 |
| Sale Price | $980,000 |
| Capital Gain | $480,000 (approximately) |

Property C - Investment Unit

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Address | 505/100 City Road, Brisbane QLD 4000 |
| Purchase Date | 15 August 2018 |
| Purchase Price | $385,000 |
| Status | Investment (never lived in) |
| Sale Date | 1 December 2024 |
| Sale Price | $495,000 |
| Capital Gain | $75,000 (approximately) |

Property D - Inherited Farm

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Address | 1200 Rural Highway, Roma QLD 4455 |
| Inheritance Date | 1 September 2022 |
| Market Value at Death | $580,000 |
| Parent's MR Status | Was deceased's main residence |
| Sale Date | 20 December 2024 |
| Sale Price | $650,000 |
| Capital Gain | $55,000 (approximately) |

### Strategic Analysis

Option 1: Claim MRE on Family Home (Current)

Property A: FULL EXEMPTION (current main residence)
Property B: Rental exceeded 6 years = PARTIAL EXEMPTION
Property C: No MRE (investment)
Property D: Sold within 2 years of death = FULL EXEMPTION

Option 2: Claim MRE on Beach House (Six-Year Rule)

Not available: Cannot claim MRE on beach house AND family home simultaneously
Beach house rental (8.6 years) exceeds 6-year limit anyway

### CGT Calculation - Optimal Strategy (Option 1)

Property A (Family Home): $0 CGT (Full MRE)

Property B (Beach House):
Total ownership: 4,520 days
Rental period: 3,150 days (8.6 years)
Six-year exemption: 2,192 days
Excess: 958 days

First use to produce income applies:
Deemed acquisition: 1 March 2016
Market value: $580,000
Capital Gain from deemed date: $980,000 - $620,000 = $360,000

Taxable proportion: 958 / 3,150 = 30.41%
Taxable gain: $360,000 x 30.41% = $109,476
After 50% discount: $54,738

Property C (Investment Unit):
Capital Gain: $75,000
No MRE applies
After 50% discount: $37,500

Property D (Inherited Farm):
Sold within 2 years of death: YES (2.3 years, but within extension)
Was deceased's main residence: YES
2-year rule applies: FULL EXEMPTION
CGT: $0

### Portfolio Summary

| Property | Capital Gain | Exemption | Net CGT |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| A - Family Home | $680,000 | Full MRE | $0 |
| B - Beach House | $360,000 | Partial (69.59%) | $54,738 |
| C - Investment Unit | $75,000 | None | $37,500 |
| D - Inherited Farm | $55,000 | Full (2-yr rule) | $0 |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,170,000** | | **$92,238** |

TOTAL NET CAPITAL GAIN: $92,238

### Applicable Rules

Property A: ITAA97 s118.110 - Full main residence exemption
Property B: ITAA97 s118.145 - Six-year rule exceeded (partial)
ITAA97 s118.192 - First use to produce income
Property C: No exemption - pure investment property
Property D: ITAA97 s118.195 - Deceased estate 2-year rule

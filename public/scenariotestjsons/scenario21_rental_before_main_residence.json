    "description": "Alexander purchased a bungalow on 10th October 2008 for $400,000 and immediately rented it out. The tenant occupied the property from 10th October 2008 until 1st November 2013. After the tenant moved out, Alexander moved in and established it as his main residence until selling on 1st January 2015 for $650,000. This scenario demonstrates CGT implications when a property is first used for income-producing purposes before becoming a main residence.",
